API Rate Limits

Instagram API has certain rate limits you need to be aware of:

Basic Instagram API Rate Limits:

200 GET requests per hour for user-related data (such as followers, following).


Be cautious with frequent API requests as exceeding the limit can result in temporary suspension of API access. Itâ€™s recommended to add delays between API calls or use batch requests to stay within the limit.

If your app frequently exceeds rate limits, you may consider:

Caching API responses locally.

Spreading requests over a longer time frame.

Upgrading your API access if necessary.
